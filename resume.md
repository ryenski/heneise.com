### Senior Software Engineer at SRS Acquiom
January 2023—Present

SRS Acquiom provides a suite of software platforms to support the logistical needs of companies performing mergers and acquisitions. As Senior Software Engineer I worked chiefly on the Ruby on Rails backend for the Virtual Data Room (VDR) platform. As a very large legacy codebase, the VDR presented many interesting challenges. I implemented several new features, assisted with bug fixes and changes to existing features, refactored existing code, performed code reviews, and participated in the Scrum process.

### Senior Full Stack Engineer at Swan Bitcoin

Swan Bitcoin is a Bitcoin exchange that helps people buy and self-custody Bitcoin. As Senior Full Stack Engineer I worked with the product team to add features to the Node.js backend and React frontend of Swan's flagship product. I helped to implement an account-based permission policy, and participated in an application-wide domain model overhaul to allow a user to login to multiple accounts. 

### Lead Developer at Dime Technology
May 2019—January 2022

Dime Giving is an integrated online donation and financial accounting product for nonprofit organizations. Formerly a client, Dime Technology hired me to help launch their flagship donation accounting platform, which I had previously built with my team as a contractor. In addition to processing online donations through several different payment APIs, Dime Giving is also a full-featured nonprofit accounting and reporting platform powered by a double-entry account ledger system. 

I worked directly with the Chief Executive Officer to develop the product strategy, design and engineer the Dime Giving application using Ruby on Rails, StimulusJS, Slim, and Tailwind SCSS. I hired and organized the small development team, and managed multiple projects, successfully implementing the Shape Up methodology with my team. 

### Founder and Lead Developer at Booster Stage, Inc.
Nov 2004—April 2019

Booster Stage is my own web development agency that has enabled me to provide outstanding value to clients in need of rapidly-deployed custom web-based software solutions. During my time at Booster Stage I developed multiple greenfield MVP web-based applications for startup clients, principally engineered using Ruby on Rails, StimulusJS, and TailwindCSS. I hired and managed a small team of employees and contractors. I built a book of business and developed marketing and sales funnels.

### Founder and Developer at Donor Tools
August 2007—December 2014

I created Donor Tools, one of the first modern web-based donor management and online donations systems for nonprofit organizations. Donor Tools allows nonprofit organizations to set up fundraising pages and track donors and their contributions. Features include donor reports, dynamic Smart Tags, PayPal donations, QuickBooks integration, and more.  
  
Donor Tools was designed to serve small nonprofit organizations who at the time had very few affordable alternatives for online donations and donor management. I built the product from the ground up, marketed the product, and supported the product until it was acquired by my partners.

### Web Development Team Lead at Biola University
January 2004—December 2004
