### Business

* Currently working as a senior software enginer for [SRS Acquiom](http://srsacquiom.com)
* [MemberDrive.org](https://MemberDrive.org) is my side hustle but becoming more than that since I took on a business partner to help spin up the marketing flywheel. MemberDrive is a fundraising platform that helps charities build recurring revenue through memberships. Members ❤️ MemberDrive. 
* I’m freelancing through my agency [Booster Stage](https://boosterstage.net). I help nonprofit organizations create online payment systems. 
* I sold my previous business, Donor Tools, to my partners in 2015.
* Previously I worked as a software engineer for [Swan Bitcoin](http://swanbitcoin.com).
