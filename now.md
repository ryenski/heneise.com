### Business

* Currently working as a senior software enginer for [SRS Acquiom](http://srsacquiom.com)
* [MemberDrive.org](https://MemberDrive.org) is my side hustle but becoming more than that since I took on a business partner to help spin up the marketing flywheel. MemberDrive is a fundraising platform that helps charities build recurring revenue through memberships. Members ❤️ MemberDrive. 
* I’m freelancing through my agency [Booster Stage](https://boosterstage.net). I help nonprofit organizations create online payment systems. 
* I sold my previous business, Donor Tools, to my partners in 2015.
* Just finished a short tenure as a software engineer for [Swan Bitcoin](http://swanbitcoin.com).

### Family

*   In 2021 we went to Haiti for a three-month missionary experience. Check out our blog [heneisefamily.substack.com](https://heneisefamily.substack.com).
*   Bethany is homeschooling our kids.

### Hobbies

*   Shooting. I wish I could do more of this, but shooting classes are expensive. Still, dry-fire training is cheap, so I make due.
*   Homesteading. In addition to the greenhouse we now have a new hugelculture and two fruit tree orchards. Each fruit tree is in the process of becoming a tree guild.
*   I raise pigs, rabbits, and chickens for eggs and meat. 

### Books I’m reading

*   _The Picture of Dorian Gray_, by Oscar Wilde
*   _Dracula_ by Bram Stoker
*   _Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life_ by Jordan B. Peterson
